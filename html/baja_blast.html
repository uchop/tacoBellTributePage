        <p>Taco Bell's Mountain Dew Baja Blast Freeze is pretty much a Baja Blast-flavored slushie. It looks like the Freezes are replacing the Frutista Freezes on the Taco Bell menu. The price is the same though: $1.99 for a 16-ounce medium. It's only $1 during Taco Bell's new Happier Hour though.</p>
