        <p>Taco Bell's new Spicy Potato Soft Taco features crispy potato bites, shredded lettuce, chipotle sauce, and shredded cheddar cheese in a warm flour tortilla for $1. It's pretty much a replacement for the Crispy Potato Soft Taco, but with a spicy chipotle sauce rather than pepper jack sauce.</p>
