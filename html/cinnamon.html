        <p>Review: Taco Bell - Cinnabon Delights. One of the more interesting on Taco Bell's current breakfast menu test, Cinnabon Delights feature donut-hole-like balls filled with a sweet cream cheese frosting and dusted with cinnamon and sugar. An order of four Cinnabon Delights costs $1.49 and are about 50 calories per ball.</p>
