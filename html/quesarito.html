        <p>The quesarito is a current menu item available at Taco Bell. It has the key components of a quesadilla and burrito rolled into one, and one is usually filled with seasoned beef, premium Latin rice, Chipotle sauce, reduced-fat sour cream, and then wrapped up in a grilled quesadilla loaded with melted cheeses.</p>
